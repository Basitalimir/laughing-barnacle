        <h1>Introducing my first ever website color; black;</h1>
    </div>
    Firstly, I decided on the purpose of my website and what I wanted to achieve with it. This helped me to create a clear vision and focus for my website. Next, I chose a website builder that suited my needs, which was user-friendly and offered a range of templates and features to choose from.
        Once I had selected my website builder, I started designing my website, choosing colors, images, and layouts that reflected my brand and message. I wrote content for my website pages, ensuring that it was clear, concise, and engaging for my target audience.
        Finally, I tested my website to ensure that it was functioning correctly and optimized for search engines. After making a few tweaks and finalizing the design, I was ready to launch my website. It was an incredibly rewarding experience to see my hard work come to life on the web. I am proud of my first website and excited to continue learning and growing as a web developer.
